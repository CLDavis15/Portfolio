      <p>Full Stack Web Developer with a strong work ethic and sense of humor that helps to bring the best out of everyone in any environment. My competitive drive makes for peak performance in the business and in turns builds relationships built on trust and respect. </p>

      <p>Time management has helped building my portfolio, which has help with refining my skills as a developer with different front and back end applications. I am transitioning from a Construction career which has shown me that technology has a key influence these days in that field. Being able to develop new ways to help out the customers and businesses has lead me into attending the UNCC bootcamp.</p>

      <p>The bootcamp has helped in building my Javascript, React and node skills tremendously. From my past and present experiences I know I’d be a great candidate for the company because of my work ethic and attention detail that I’ve gained. As well as being able to communicate with a team and generating a positive work environment for me and the others around me.
